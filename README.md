TODO: Add configuration for [Ax-Shell](https://github.com/Axenide/Ax-Shell)

## Features
### Applicable to Arch Linux and its derivatives
- Installs appropriate GPU drivers.
- Sets up yay if there's no supported AUR helper installed.
- Installs packages listed in the configuration (Manage in `.chezmoidata/linux/arch/packages.yaml`.)
- Enables multilib repository for gaming-ready configuration.

### Applicable to all distros
#### Dotfiles
- Sane configuration for various tools:
  - Electron - Multiple versions and variations such as Spotify and Vesktop supported via symlinking.
  - Fastfetch - More minimal appearance
  - GameMode
    - Enables performance mode when gaming and switches back to balanced mode after the session.
    - Disables blur and animations on Hyprland during gaming.
    - Includes workaround for Intel CPUs being locked into performance mode.
  - Helix - Better coloring
  - Kanata - Upstream rebinds Caps Lock to function differently, fork removes that rebind and repurposes it to rebind menu key as right CTRL
  - Kitty Terminal - Consistent appearance configuration
  - MatUGen - For dynamic coloring across multiple CLI tools and UI kits (Qt 5, Qt 6, GTK3, GTK4) when setting wallpapers. `matugen image /path/to/image [-m dark|light]` to get started. If using Vesktop, also set client theme to "Material You" local theme that will be generated for you.
  - ZSH - Keybinds and environment variables mostly
- PowerLevel10K Oh My Posh prompt
- Custom sane Hyprland configuration

#### Common scripts
- Fixes "Open with" dialog in Dolphin not receiving list of installed apps.

## Installation

`yay -S chezmoi`

To gather the initial configuration:
```
chezmoi init https://github.com/kurtbahartr/Linda-Dots
```

> [!WARNING]
> It's important to review the configuration in `.chezmoidata`! That folder contains most of the out-of-home configuration (such as packages to install and services to enable)!

To `cd` into the directory where the repository has been cloned:
```
chezmoi cd
```

To finally apply the dotfiles after editing files in `.chezmoidata`:
```
chezmoi apply
```

To get and apply dotfile updates:

```
chezmoi update
```

To see what chezmoi would update x file to be run eg.:

```
chezmoi cat ~/.zshrc
```

Additional configuration is required for MatUGen colors to possess Zen Browser:

Install this Firefox plugin first:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pywalfox/

And then follow these instructions:
https://github.com/Axenide/PywalZen#installation

> [!WARNING]
> PywalZen is currently broken, but PywalFox works just fine for Firefox.
